# Brain & Nornir Hackathon 2023

Build a collection of services for processing data, analyzing trends, and triggering actions based on certain conditions. By adding new services to the network it becomes smarter. Each team will build services to provide some value to the Hive network. There are no limitations on the type of service.

## Setup

Each team will be granted with predefined domain, token, and username(email). With this setup, they will be able to perform all necessary API calls listed below.

## Bounty program

As Hive is still in the proof of concept, participants can find some bugs or features that can be fixed or have better implementations. I think if students can explain with an argument the problem that they found, they can be rewarded with some points for their team.
