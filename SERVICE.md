# Service

Is a program that should send some data into the network, AI generated result, sensor data and etc... Each service should be documented so anyone can understand what itâ€™s doing. Documentation should contain:

  - **Overview**. Brief description of what the service is doing.
  - **Data schema**. For example: if you have a schema with 2 elements, input, and output then people most likely need to know only about the output element. Combined with the service overview this should provide enough information for end users.
  - **Linking**. How people can link to you. **NB! Maybe some UI can be done for this task**.
  - **Ghosts**. How to receive a ghost. **NB! Ghost should be explained in the presentation**. It can be done manually by the service provider or **NB! Maybe some UI can be done for this task**.
  
## Example

### Description

This is an AI service. I process data from the sensor and share results with the network.

### Data Schema

```xml
<RTW>
  <SENDER></SENDER>
  <PAYLOAD></PAYLOAD>
</RTW>
```

### Linking

Service address is a string that contains domain and service names in format **domain/service**.
Linking element is **@domain/service#element@**.

  1. Add link for some service by using API.
  2. Update data schema with the linking to element.
  
Example below showes how service B data schema should look like to be able receive OUTPUT from service A.

```xml
<!--Service A-->
<RTW>
  <INPUT></INPUT>
  <OUTPUT></OUTPUT>
</RTW>

<!--Service B-->
<RTW>
  <INPUT>@BRAIN/A#OUTPUT@</INPUT>
  <OUTPUT></OUTPUT>
</RTW>
```

### Ghosts

Explain how other teams can get a ghost from your service.

  - Contact one of team members.
  - Provide UI.
